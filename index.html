            There are a significant amount of skills I would like to learn from this class. Due to the fact I believe
            many of my previous co-workers and friends have interesting business ideas, I want to be able to make an
            online persona for their propositions. Having worked in the bar and restaurant industry for the better part
            of ten years, I've developed relationships with owners, brewers, chefs, bartenders, and the like. Being able
            to navigate and create web pages by mastering HTML and CSS will be essential to further my career outside of
            the bar industry. I would like to refine my online analytical skills in order to better understand the needs
            and wants of online consumers. Being able to better understand web statistics will lead to me creating more
            appealing websites. Before this particular assignment, I didn't realize my need to understand search engine
            optimization for the web pages I'll be creating. This will help me move beyond the technical side of web
            development to improving my content writing skills.
            I'm not sure how in depth this class will cover responsive design, but the way websites are displayed across
            different devices interests me in that no one uses only one machine to view them anymore.

            I currently don't have a career that requires any skills that this bootcamp will be providing. However, this
            will hopefully lead to job opportunities where I can utilize web development skills and my knowledge of food
            and beverage service to broaden my horizons into a fully fledged career. By the end of this course I would
            like to at least be able to create websites for bars, restaurants, and fledgling breweries to help them
            succeed online. I know that my interpersonal skills would be essential in helping these businesses to build
            a vast clientele. I know that if I help these individuals do well, that will be the most fulfilling way I
            can use my abilities.
